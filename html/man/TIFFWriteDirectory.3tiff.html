<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p><i>TIFFWriteDirectory</i> will write the contents of the
current directory to the file and setup to create a new
subfile in the same file. <i>TIFFWriteDirectory</i> will free up the directory data structures in memory.
Applications only need to call
<i>TIFFWriteDirectory</i> when writing multiple subfiles to
a single <small>TIFF</small> file. <i>TIFFWriteDirectory</i>
is automatically called by <i>TIFFClose</i> and
<i>TIFFFlush</i> to write a modified directory if the file
is open for writing. <i>TIFFWriteDirectory</i> sets the current directory index, but NOT the CurrentDirOffset!
</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>The <i>TIFFRewriteDirectory</i> function operates
similarly to <i>TIFFWriteDirectory,</i> but can be called
with directories previously read or written that already
have an established location in the file. It will rewrite
the directory, but instead of place it at it&rsquo;s old
location (as <i>TIFFWriteDirectory</i> would) it will place
them at the end of the file, correcting the pointer from the
preceding directory or file header to point to it&rsquo;s
new location. This is particularly important in cases where
the size of the directory and pointed to data has grown, so
it won&rsquo;t fit in the space available at the old
location.</p>
<!-- INDENTATION -->
<p>The <i>TIFFCheckpointDirectory</i> writes the current
state of the tiff directory into the file to make what is
currently in the file readable. However, sometimes the file-writing is delayed, especially if 
<i>TIFFCheckpointDirectory</i> is called several times.
<BR>Unlike<i>TIFFWriteDirectory, TIFFCheckpointDirectory</i> does not
free up the directory data structures in memory, so they can
be updated (as strips/tiles are written) and written again.
Reading such a partial file you will at worst get a tiff
read error for the first strip/tile encountered that is
incomplete, but you will at least get all the valid data in
the file before that. When the file is complete, just use
<i>TIFFWriteDirectory</i> as usual to finish it off
cleanly.</p>
<p>The <i>TIFFWriteCheck()</i> verifies that the file is writable and that the directory
information is setup properly.  In doing the latter we also "freeze" the state of the directory so
that important information is not changed.<BR>
On the first write verify all the required information has been setup and initialize any data structures that
had to wait until directory information was set.
Note that a lot of our work is assumed to remain valid because we disallow any of the important parameters
from changing after we start writing (i.e. once TIFF_BEENWRITING is set, TIFFSetField will only allow
the image's length to be changed).<br>

<p>Be aware, that <i>TIFFWriteDirectory()</i> frees the <i>*tif</i> structure and sets up a new one. 
Therefore, the current directory index, retrieved with <i>TIFFCurrentDirectory()</i>, is NOT valid, nor the directory offset using <i>TIFFCurrentDirOffset()</i>.
<i>TIFFCurrentDirectory()</i> will return the index of the previously directory, if a valid one was written. 
<i>TIFFCurrentDirOffset()</i> will only return a valid directory offset, after the values are reread from file using <i>TIFFSetDirectory()</i> or <i>TIFFReadDirectory()</i>.
<br>In contrast, <i>TIFFCheckpointDirectory()</i> updates the current directory index and the directory offset in the <i>*tif</i> structure!
</p>
<p><i>TIFFCheckpointDirectory()</i> itself does not reset the TIFF_DIRTYDIRECT flag. Only a following <i>TIFFSetDirectory()</i> 
or <i>TIFFCreateDirectory()</i> will clear the flag.<BR>
If TIFF_DIRTYDIRECT flag is set when the file is closed, the dirctory will be re-written at the end of the file instead of just been updated.
